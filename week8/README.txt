In this assignment you have to submit a standalone Haskell program that can be compiled using the ghc compiler.  Your program should read some lines of text and print them out in reverse order, with each line individually reversed.  The input will end with a line containing the letters "EOF".

For instance, if the input is the following

Line 1
Line 2
EOF

your program should output

1 eniL
2 eniL
